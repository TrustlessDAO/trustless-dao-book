# The Problem

## Current Limitations

Most Web3 security researchers limit their work to projects with official bug bounty programs. This creates a dangerous imbalance:
- White-hat researchers only look at bounty-covered code
- Black-hat attackers look everywhere
- Many protocols remain under-examined by friendly researchers

## The Disclosure Challenge

When researchers find vulnerabilities in protocols without bounty programs, they face a difficult choice:

1. Share the vulnerability details upfront and hope for fair compensation
2. Keep the information private, leaving protocols vulnerable

Neither option is good for the ecosystem. Researchers who choose to disclose often end up providing valuable information without compensation, while protocols miss opportunities to fix vulnerabilities before they're exploited.

## What's Needed

A simple system that:
- Protects researchers when sharing valuable information
- Gives protocols confidence in the disclosure process
- Creates clear evidence of all commitments
- Enables fair compensation for valuable discoveries

The next chapter explains how IndependentDisclosure provides these protections through minimal but effective mechanisms.
