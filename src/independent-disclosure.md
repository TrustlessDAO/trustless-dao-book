# IndependentDisclosure

TrustlessDAO offers a [public template repository](https://github.com/TrustlessDAO/independent-disclosure) designed to create a structured and secure environment for vulnerability disclosure. The repository includes:

- `README.md`: Comprehensive process documentation  
- `report.md`: Template for vulnerability details  
- `initial-terms.md`: Researcher's suggested terms  
- `authorization.md`: Protocol's formal commitment  
- `protocol-assessment.md`: Protocol's validity assessment  
- `final-terms.md`: Agreed settlement terms  

## Why This Works

The template's structure promotes good faith participation through clear, balanced incentives:

1. **Balanced Control**  
   - Researchers manage initial information sharing.  
   - Protocols control the validity assessment.  
   - Final terms require mutual agreement.

2. **Verifiable Evidence**  
   - All interactions are documented in the repository.  
   - The smart contract records key commitments on-chain.  
   - Any bad faith actions are provable without exposing vulnerabilities.

3. **Public Accountability**  
   - Either party can easily demonstrate bad faith to the community.  
   - Clear evidence of good faith is straightforward to present.  
   - A lack of evidence implies bad faith.  
   - Reputational stakes incentivize honest behavior.

## Using IndependentDisclosure

Practical guidance is available for both parties:

- **[For Researchers](./guides/researcher.md)**: How to initiate and manage a disclosure.  
- **[For Protocols](./guides/protocol.md)**: What to expect and how to participate.  

Each guide provides step-by-step instructions tailored to the specific roles of researchers and protocols in the process.
