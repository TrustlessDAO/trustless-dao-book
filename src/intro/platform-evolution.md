# The Pattern of Progress

The evolution from centralized to decentralized solutions tends to follow a pattern so clear it might seem obvious in hindsight:

### Trading
**Coinbase (2015) → EtherDelta (2016) → Uniswap (2018)**
- Coinbase established the traditional centralized exchange model
- EtherDelta pioneered decentralization but with traditional orderbook mechanics
- Uniswap revolutionized trading through automated market making (AMM)
- Result: Each iteration brought unique benefits, with AMMs emerging as the decentralized category winner

### Protocol Audit Coverage
**Sherlock (2021) → SpearbitDAO (2022)**
- Sherlock introduced open audit contests where anyone can participate
- SpearbitDAO began with private audits and evolved to include Cantina's hybrid model
- Result: More dynamic and community-driven security auditing approaches

### Bug Bounties
**HackerOne (2012) → ImmuneFi (2020) → TrustlessDAO (2024)**
- HackerOne standardized bug bounty programs
- ImmuneFi specialized for Web3
- TrustlessDAO aims to decentralize the model entirely
- Result: Each evolution expanded the scope of what's possible in security

> The question isn't whether decentralized bug bounty platforms will emerge, but why they haven't already. The answer lies in the complexity of designing new mechanisms that can truly improve upon existing solutions.
