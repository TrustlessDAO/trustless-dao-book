# The Free-First Model

Where traditional bug bounty platforms often constrain researchers, TrustlessDAO envisions a more open approach to security research. This chapter explores how removing these traditional constraints can lead to better security outcomes for the entire ecosystem.

## Beyond Traditional Boundaries

The free-first model represents a philosophical shift in how we view security research:

- **Unlimited Scope**: Any aspect of any protocol can be examined
- **Unlimited Time**: Research proceeds at its natural pace
- **Zero Upfront Cost**: Protocols pay nothing until value is demonstrated
- **Fair Compensation**: Payment aligns with the value provided

This approach creates opportunities for deeper, more comprehensive security research that isn't constrained by artificial boundaries.

## Knowledge as the Primary Driver

At its core, the free-first model recognizes that the best security research comes from genuine curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge. This creates several powerful dynamics:

1. **Organic Skill Development**: Researchers follow their interests naturally
2. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Time to fully grasp complex systems
3. **Novel Discoveries**: Freedom to explore leads to unexpected findings
4. **Community Benefits**: Knowledge sharing improves ecosystem security

## Value Recognition and Fair Exchange

While research begins without charge, the model acknowledges that valuable discoveries deserve compensation through a simple principle:

> When a protocol demonstrates the value of a disclosure by implementing fixes, they should fairly compensate the researcher for that valuable information.

This creates natural alignment between:
- Researchers focusing on finding genuine vulnerabilities
- Protocols paying only for actionable information
- The ecosystem benefiting from improved security

## A New Security Paradigm

The free-first model addresses a fundamental imbalance in the current security landscape. While malicious actors operate without constraints, white-hat researchers are often limited by formal program boundaries. By removing these artificial limitations, TrustlessDAO helps level the playing field:

- White-hats gain the same freedom as black-hats
- All protocols benefit from security research
- The entire ecosystem becomes more secure

This represents the next evolution in Web3 security - one where artificial constraints are removed, and natural incentives drive better security outcomes for everyone.
