# Seeing Beyond Current Systems

Consider the state of Web3 security before ImmuneFi's launch in 2020. The infamous DAO hack of 2016, caused by a simple reentrancy bug, led to Ethereum's first hard fork. If you had asked security professionals then how to prevent such incidents, most would have suggested:
- More developer training
- Stricter code review processes
- Better testing frameworks

Yet none of these was the solution that ultimately transformed the landscape. Instead, it was the emergence of specialized platforms that:
- Separated security and development concerns
- Created professional bug hunting incentives
- Standardized disclosure and reward processes

### The Horse and Car Paradigm

This pattern mirrors Henry Ford's famous quote: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." In security:
- Pre-2020: Focus on making developers better at security
- Post-2020: Create specialized roles and incentives for Web3 security professionals

The lesson? Innovation often requires imagining systems that don't yet exist, rather than optimizing current ones.

### Beyond Current Platforms

Today's centralized bug bounty platforms are crucial but not final. TrustlessDAO envisions the next evolution:
- Expanding beyond traditional scope limitations
- Creating trustless disclosure mechanisms
- Leveling the playing field between white and black hats

Just as Uniswap's AMM mechanism wasn't obvious until it existed, the next breakthrough in security coordination requires both:
1. Novel mechanisms for trustless information exchange
2. Vision to imagine beyond current limitations

The true test of innovation isn't whether it seems obvious after the fact - it's whether it expands what's possible in ways people couldn't previously imagine.
