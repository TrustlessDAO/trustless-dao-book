# When Actions Match Stated Intentions

The chart below can be most easily understood by selecting an intention from the first column and then seeing how that intention maps to each of the possible actions.

|        | Pay | Not Pay | Ignore |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| Agree  | âœ… | ðŸ˜ˆ | ðŸ˜ˆ |
| Reject | ðŸ¤” | âœ… | âœ… |
| Ignore | ðŸ¤” | âœ… | âœ…|

&nbsp;

|    | Meanings |
|----|---------|
| âœ… | Ok! |
| ðŸ˜ˆ | You might be a bad person |
| ðŸ¤” | Seek God |

As the chart demonstrates, the honest actions are those in which stated intentions and actions are aligned. The opposite, where a mismatch is present, should be considered deceptive actions. The ideal would be to reward honesty and penalize deception. Next, we'll discuss how deception can be minimized, even when not all participants are honest.
