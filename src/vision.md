# Vision and Next Steps

While IndependentDisclosure already provides a functional framework for peer-to-peer vulnerability disclosure, our vision extends beyond the current implementation. We're working to make this process not just possible, but the preferred choice for both researchers and protocols.

## Immediate Goals

### Vulnerability Valuation  
Our next milestone is to develop a tool that helps both parties arrive at fair compensation range suggestions for specific vulnerability classes given circumstances like funds at risk:  
- **Structured Frameworks**: Guidelines for justifying suggested payment ranges for specific disclosures.  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Leveraging data to create transparent valuation models.

### Protocol Outreach  
We’re focused on raising awareness among protocols about the advantages of this approach:  
- **Cost-Free Implementation**: No upfront or ongoing costs for protocols.  
- **Expanded Research Base**: Broader access to security researchers.  
- **Transparent Processes**: Evidence-based interactions.  
- **Freedom from Lock-In**: No dependence on centralized platforms.

## Future Development

### Arbiter System  
We’re developing a dispute resolution system to handle conflicts fairly and transparently:  
- **Evidence Review**: Assess inputs from the disclosure process.  
- **Transparent Verdicts**: Issue rulings based on clear, objective criteria.  
- **Reputation Penalties**: Apply on-chain consequences for bad faith actions.  
- **Precedent Creation**: Establish guiding cases for future disclosures.

### Process Enhancements  
We’re continuously improving the user experience to ensure smoother adoption:  
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Simplify every step of the process.  
- **Friction Reduction**: Eliminate barriers for both parties.  
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Provide clear, actionable guides.  
- **Advanced Tooling**: Develop intuitive tools to facilitate participation and successful negotiations.

## The Long-Term Vision  

Our ultimate aim is to make peer-to-peer vulnerability disclosure the norm. Indicators of success include:  
- **Widespread Adoption**: Direct disclosure becomes a common practice.  
- **Simplicity**: Processes as user-friendly as traditional approaches, or better.  
- **Standards of Good Faith**: Clearly defined and widely accepted expectations.  
- **Improved Security**: Tangible benefits for the entire Web3 ecosystem.

IndependentDisclosure is just the foundation. We are committed to evolving and expanding this system until direct disclosure is the default choice for researchers and protocols alike. We hope you will join us on this journey.
