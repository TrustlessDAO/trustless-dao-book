# The Judicial Phase

Traditional platforms often bind participants with complex terms and conditions that limit their ability to speak openly about disputes. This creates an imbalanced system where the platform, not the evidence, decides the outcome.

Our framework takes a different approach: when disputes arise, let the evidence speak for itself in the court of public opinion.

This works because:
- All key moments have verifiable on-chain evidence
- Git commits provide immutable timestamps
- Cross-platform messages prove intent
- Communication attempts are documented
- Neither party is bound by silence

When bad faith occurs, it becomes obvious through the evidence trail. A party claiming they never authorized participation must explain away their Git commits and public messages. A party claiming they never received contact must address documented attempts across multiple channels. A party claiming different terms must explain why they accepted the on-chain state transitions.

Both sides are free to present their case publicly - sharing evidence, revealing repositories, and making their arguments. No platform controls this process. No terms prevent full disclosure. The truth emerges through verifiable evidence rather than platform decrees.

This creates powerful incentives for honest behavior. Participants know that acting in bad faith means eventually facing public scrutiny with evidence they cannot deny. The side with the strongest verifiable evidence will tend to prevail in public opinion, making honest dealing the most practical choice from the start.

The following chapters examine how this evidence-based resolution process works in practice.
