# The Free-First Model

Where traditional bug bounty platforms often constrain researchers, TrustlessDAO envisions a more open approach to security research. This chapter explores how removing these traditional constraints can lead to better security outcomes for the entire ecosystem.

## Breaking Free of Current Limitations

The free-first model is characterized by several key freedoms:

- **Unlimited Scope**: Researchers can examine any aspect of a protocol's implementation
- **Unlimited Time**: No artificial deadlines or competition periods
- **Zero Cost**: No upfront payment required from protocols
- **Fair Compensation**: Payment expectations align with the value provided

This approach stands in stark contrast to traditional bounty programs where researchers must carefully consider whether their time investment will be worthwhile given scope restrictions and competition dynamics within a large but not unlimited pool of listed audit candidates.

## The Knowledge-First Incentive

A core principle of the free-first model is that security research should be driven primarily by genuine interest and the pursuit of knowledge. This creates several powerful dynamics:

1. **Natural Skill Development**: Researchers can follow their curiosity and develop expertise organically
2. **Deeper Understanding**: Without time pressure, researchers can thoroughly understand complex systems
3. **Innovation in Research**: Freedom to explore can lead to novel vulnerability discoveries
4. **Community Knowledge**: Findings can benefit the broader security community

## Value-Based Compensation

While research begins free of charge, the model recognizes that valuable discoveries deserve compensation. This occurs through a simple principle:

> If a protocol demonstrates the value of a disclosure by implementing fixes, they should fairly compensate the researcher for that valuable information.

This creates a natural alignment of incentives:
- Researchers focus on finding genuine vulnerabilities
- Protocols only pay for actionable, valuable information
- The ecosystem benefits from improved security

## Bridging Security Gaps

The free-first model addresses a critical gap in the current security landscape. While white-hat researchers are often limited to defined scopes and programs, malicious actors face no such constraints. By removing these artificial limitations, TrustlessDAO helps level the playing field:

- White-hats can match the freedom of black-hats
- All protocols benefit from security research, not just those with formal programs
- The entire ecosystem becomes more secure through unrestricted positive-sum security research

This approach represents the next evolution in Web3 security, building upon but extending far beyond the capabilities of existing platforms.
