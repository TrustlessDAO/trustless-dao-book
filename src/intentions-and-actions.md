# Intentions and Actions

## Scenario: A Random Person Asks You for Money on the Street

While most people have encountered this scenario themselves, most likely havenâ€™t considered it in terms of intentions and actions.

For our purposes, let's assume that the only possible intentions you can broadcast to this seeker of funds are: `Agree, Reject, or Ignore`

Additionally, only if you broadcast the Agree intention do you open the possibility of selecting your next action, where the options are: `Pay, Not Pay, or Ignore`

> Note: Select which intention/action combination you most often take so that your actions can be ~~judged~~... assessed on the next page.
