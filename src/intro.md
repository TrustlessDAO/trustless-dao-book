# Introduction

Blockchains and smart contract have existed for many years now, yet the on-chain economy isn't nearly as vibrant and dynamic as it could be. A major reason for this is related to trust, especially for transactions that involve the exchange of potentially valuable information for a monetary reward.  


One of the clearest examples of this in the web3 security space where security researchers strive to uncover and disclose bugs to vulnerable protocols before they are discovered and exploited by malicious actors. 

The majority of researchers currently limit their auditing to the projects listed on Bug Bounty Platforms like [ImmuneFi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/), and normally only to the subset of assets each project specifies as being within their specified scope. The result is an uneven security landscaope where white-hats have limited incentives to search outside of defined scopes while black-hats remain incentivized to search everything.

Discosures of bugs found outside of the offical scopes currently do occur but leave the discloser vulnerable to [non-ideal outcomes](https://x.com/WhiteHatMage/status/1850899212902310004). This happens because the discloser loses nearly all leverage once the information is shared. We believe this can be improved by adjusting incentives.
