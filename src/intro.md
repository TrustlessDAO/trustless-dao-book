# Introduction

Blockchains and smart contracts have existed for many years now, yet the on-chain economy isn't nearly as vibrant and dynamic as it could be. A major reason for this is related to trust, especially for transactions that involve the exchange of potentially valuable information for a monetary reward.


One of the clearest examples of this is in the Web3 security space, where security researchers strive to uncover and disclose bugs to vulnerable protocols before they are found and exploited by malicious actors.

The majority of researchers currently limit their auditing to projects listed on Bug Bounty Platforms like [ImmuneFi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/), and normally only to the subset of assets each project specifies as being within scope. The result is an uneven security landscape where white-hats have limited incentives to search outside of defined scopes, while black-hats remain incentivized to search everything.

Disclosures of bugs found outside of the official scopes do currently occur but leave the discloser vulnerable to [non-ideal outcomes](https://x.com/WhiteHatMage/status/1850899212902310004). This happens because the discloser loses nearly all leverage once the information is shared.

We believe this can be improved through the creation of a dynamic and verifiable on-chain reputation. To understand how such a reputation can be created, we must first consider the concepts of intention and action.
