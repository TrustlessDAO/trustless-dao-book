# A Warm Welcome To You

TrustlessDAO explores how minimal smart contracts combined with structured processes can enable effective peer-to-peer agreements in Web3. Our first focus is on vulnerability disclosures outside of official bug bounty programs.

## What We've Built

**IndependentDisclosure** is a minimal system that helps security researchers safely disclose vulnerabilities to protocols, even when no official bug bounty program exists. It combines:

- A simple smart contract that records key commitments
- A standardized GitHub repository structure for secure communication
- Clear procedures that protect both parties through transparency

## Quick Overview

In the following chapters, you'll learn:
- Why vulnerability disclosure outside bounty programs is challenging
- How IndependentDisclosure protects both researchers and protocols
- Practical steps to start using the system today

Whether you're a security researcher who has found a vulnerability or a protocol representative who's been contacted about one, you'll find clear, actionable information here.
