# A Warm Welcome to You

TrustlessDAO explores how minimal smart contracts, combined with structured off-chain processes, can enable effective peer-to-peer agreements in Web3. Our initial focus is on vulnerability disclosures outside official bug bounty programs.

## What We've Built

IndependentDisclosure is a streamlined system that helps security researchers safely disclose vulnerabilities to protocols, even when no official bug bounty program exists. It combines:

- A simple smart contract that records key commitments.
- A standardized private GitHub repository structure for secure communication.
- Clear procedures that protect both parties through transparency.

## Quick Overview

In the following chapters, you'll learn:
- Why vulnerability disclosure outside bounty programs is challenging.
- How IndependentDisclosure protects both researchers and protocols.
- Practical steps to start using the system today.

Whether you're a security researcher who has found a vulnerability or a protocol representative who has been contacted about one, you'll find clear, actionable information here.
