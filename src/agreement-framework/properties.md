# Framework Properties

Our agreement framework exhibits several key properties that make it both practical and effective. Understanding these properties helps explain why this approach works and how it can be applied to other types of agreements.

## Minimal But Sufficient State

The on-chain component maintains just three states:
- Agreement initiated
- Initial terms accepted
- Final terms accepted

This minimalism is powerful because it:
- Reduces complexity and potential bugs
- Focuses on truly essential moments
- Creates unambiguous state transitions
- Keeps gas costs low

Yet these states are sufficient to anchor the entire agreement process, providing clear evidence of what happened when.

## Verifiable Off-Chain Evidence

The framework creates multiple layers of evidence:
- Git commit histories provide immutable timestamps
- Cross-platform verification through public channels
- On-chain transactions prove wallet control
- Documented communication attempts

This evidence is:
- Difficult to fake
- Easy to verify
- Permanent
- Publicly accessible when needed
- Private until appropriate

## Staged Information Release

The Gradual Disclosure Process creates powerful incentives through carefully controlled information release:
- Each stage reveals just enough to prove legitimacy
- Time pressure increases gradually
- Engagement is rewarded with immediate process pause
- Public disclosure remains a last resort

This creates natural motivation for timely engagement while remaining ethical and professional.

## Protection For All Parties

The framework protects both sides:
- Initiators maintain leverage through GDP
- Responders can verify before engaging
- Both parties create evidence of good faith
- Neither side must trust the other
- Information remains private until appropriate

This balanced protection encourages participation without requiring blind trust.

## Practical Enforceability

Unlike complex on-chain enforcement mechanisms, this framework is enforced through:
- Clear evidence trails
- Reputational consequences
- Economic incentives
- Public accountability

This makes agreements practically enforceable without requiring complex trusted arbitrators or elaborate on-chain mechanisms.

## Composability

These properties make the framework highly adaptable:
- Core mechanics work for various agreement types
- Off-chain processes can be customized
- Timeline can adjust to different needs
- Evidence standards can evolve

While we've focused on one specific use case, the underlying pattern could enable many types of decentralized agreements.
