# The TrustlessDAO Book

This book explains how security researchers can safely disclose vulnerabilities to protocols, even when no official bug bounty program exists. We explore:

## The Current Problem
- White-hat researchers limit themselves to bounty-covered code
- Black-hat hackers look everywhere 
- Many protocols remain under-examined by friendly researchers

## A Better Approach
IndependentDisclosure combines:
- A simple smart contract that records key commitments
- A standardized GitHub repository structure for secure communication
- Clear procedures that protect both parties through transparency

The system enables researchers to work as freely as black-hat counterparts while maintaining strong ethical standards.
